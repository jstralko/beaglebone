To run start up minicom with:

$> sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0

(/dev/ttyUSB0 is what i find in dmesg)

Then do crl+a o and set the Hardware Flow to NO
Then get to the u-boot prompt by pressing the enter key

u-boot#loady
crt+a s
select ymodem
select start.bin file
Wait till the file has been transfered over to the devices
u-boot#go 0x80300000
You should see:

## Starting application at 0x8030000 ...

UUUUU

If that happens you have successfully created a baremetal application on the 
beaglebone.
